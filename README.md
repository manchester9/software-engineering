## **Overview**
This repo contains books, courses, certifications, and nanodegrees that have helped me in strengthning my conceptual as well as implementatino knowledge on Software Engineering.  Organization of content helps me to document my learning experience along the way. The content is not comprehensive to everything Sofware Engineering related but focuses on areas that have helped me in my journey as an AI Engineer. If the organization of content helps someone else in their journey then even better. Individual learnings or takeaways of each of the below sections are within their respective README files
